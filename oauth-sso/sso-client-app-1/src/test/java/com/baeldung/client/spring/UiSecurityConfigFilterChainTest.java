================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: Without proper validation and escaping of the data rendered on the web pages, the application may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This can lead to unauthorized access to user session tokens, cookies, or sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that all user-supplied data is properly escaped using context-aware escaping functions provided by the framework or library in use. For Spring, consider using the built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS such as using Thymeleaf templates with proper encoding.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If error messages or stack traces are exposed to the client, sensitive information about the application's internals may be revealed, potentially aiding an attacker in crafting further attacks.
Solution: Configure the application to handle errors gracefully and return generic error messages to the client. Avoid exposing stack traces or any internal implementation details.

Vulnerability: CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication
Issue: The application appears to rely solely on OAuth2 for authentication, without enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA). If an attacker compromises user credentials, they could gain unauthorized access to the application.
Solution: Implement multi-factor authentication to provide an additional layer of security beyond just username and password or OAuth2 tokens. This can be achieved through integration with an MFA provider or by using additional verification methods like SMS or email-based codes.

Vulnerability: CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk
Issue: If the application stores sensitive information such as OAuth2 tokens or user data on disk without encryption, it may be susceptible to unauthorized access or information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that all sensitive data stored on disk is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms. Use secure storage mechanisms provided by the framework or operating system.

Vulnerability: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Issue: The use of WebClient without proper validation of URLs can lead to SSRF, where an attacker can induce the server to make requests to unintended locations.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all user-supplied URLs before using them with WebClient. Implement strict URL validation rules and consider using allowlists for allowed domains.

Vulnerability: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
Issue: If the WebClient is misconfigured, it may not properly validate SSL/TLS certificates, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the WebClient is configured to validate certificates correctly. Avoid disabling certificate validation in production environments.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: If the application does not handle session expiration appropriately, attackers may reuse old sessions to gain unauthorized access.
Solution: Configure session management to enforce session expiration after a certain period of inactivity. Implement server-side checks to invalidate sessions after logout or when they are deemed expired.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful authorization for public endpoints

Details:  
  TestName: successfulAuthorizationForPublicEndpoints
  Description: This test checks if the public endpoints ("/" and "/login**") are accessible without authentication.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object to simulate the authorization requests.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity.
  Assert: Verify that the public endpoints are configured to permit all traffic.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the public endpoints do not require authentication. This is significant because the application should allow access to these endpoints without the user being logged in.

Scenario 2: Authenticated request to a protected resource

Details:  
  TestName: authenticatedRequestToProtectedResource
  Description: This test ensures that any request to an endpoint not listed as public requires authentication.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object to simulate an authenticated request to a protected resource.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity.
  Assert: Confirm that the request to a non-public endpoint is configured to require authentication.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that authenticated access is enforced on protected endpoints. This test is crucial for security, ensuring that unauthorized access is not granted to sensitive parts of the application.

Scenario 3: OAuth2 Login configuration

Details:  
  TestName: oAuth2LoginConfiguration
  Description: The test verifies that OAuth2 login is correctly configured in the HttpSecurity object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object to simulate the security configuration.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity.
  Assert: Check that OAuth2 login is enabled and properly set up.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that OAuth2 is the chosen method for handling login authentication. The significance of this test lies in confirming that the application is leveraging OAuth2 for user authentication as intended.

Scenario 4: HttpSecurity build process

Details:  
  TestName: httpSecurityBuildProcess
  Description: This test checks if the HttpSecurity object is successfully built after configuring the security filters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and its build method.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity.
  Assert: Confirm that the build method is called at the end of configuration.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the SecurityFilterChain is correctly created from the HttpSecurity configuration. This is significant as it ensures the security configuration is correctly compiled into an operational state.

Scenario 5: Handling of HttpSecurity configuration exceptions

Details:  
  TestName: handlingHttpSecurityConfigurationException
  Description: The test ensures that the method correctly handles any exceptions that may occur during the configuration of HttpSecurity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object to throw an Exception when configuring the authorization requests.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity.
  Assert: Expect the method to propagate the exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that any exceptions during security configuration are not swallowed silently but are instead properly propagated. This is significant for error handling and debugging during the application's configuration phase.
