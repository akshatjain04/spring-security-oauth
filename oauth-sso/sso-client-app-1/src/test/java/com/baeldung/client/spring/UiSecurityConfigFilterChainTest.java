================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: Without proper validation and escaping of the data rendered on the web pages, the application may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers could inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Ensure that any data displayed to users is properly encoded or validated to prevent XSS. Use frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design such as Thymeleaf or OWASP Java Encoder.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Permitting access to the root path ('/') and login could potentially expose sensitive information if not handled properly. Attackers can gather information about the application from these pages.
Solution: Review the content served at these endpoints to ensure no sensitive information is given away. Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect unusual access patterns.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The code does not show any mechanism to prevent brute force attacks against the authentication system.
Solution: Implement account lockout, CAPTCHAs, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate brute force or credential stuffing attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: The code does not explicitly enforce the use of HTTPS, which means data in transit could be sent unencrypted and intercepted by attackers.
Solution: Force HTTPS by using a secure channel for all communications. This could be achieved by configuring the server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and using HSTS headers.

Vulnerability: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Issue: The WebClient usage is not shown, but if it interacts with untrusted URLs, it could be vulnerable to SSRF, where an attacker could induce the server to make requests to unintended locations.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all URLs before using them with WebClient. Implement a URL allowlist and consider using a dedicated library for URL parsing to avoid SSRF vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful authorization for public endpoints

Details:  
  TestName: accessPublicEndpointsWithoutAuthentication
  Description: This test ensures that public endpoints ("/" and "/login**") are accessible without requiring any authentication.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and configure it to expect the authorization requests.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the permitAll method is called for the public endpoints.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the public endpoints are correctly configured to allow unauthenticated access. This test is significant because it validates the basic security configuration that allows users to access public pages without being authenticated.

Scenario 2: Restricted access to non-public endpoints

Details:  
  TestName: restrictAccessToNonPublicEndpoints
  Description: This test checks that any request to non-public endpoints requires authentication.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and configure it to expect the authorization requests for any endpoint other than the public ones.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the authenticated method is called for any request not matching the public endpoints.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that non-public endpoints are protected and require user authentication. This is crucial for application security, ensuring that only authenticated users can access private resources.

Scenario 3: Successful setup of OAuth2 login

Details:  
  TestName: configureOAuth2LoginSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies that OAuth2 login is set up successfully within the security filter chain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object to track the configuration of OAuth2 login.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the oauth2Login method is called as part of the HttpSecurity configuration.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that OAuth2 is configured as the authentication method, which is vital for applications using OAuth2 for authentication. This test confirms that users will be able to authenticate using OAuth2 providers.

Scenario 4: Exception handling when HttpSecurity setup fails

Details:  
  TestName: throwExceptionWhenHttpSecuritySetupFails
  Description: This test ensures that the appropriate exceptions are thrown if the HttpSecurity configuration cannot be completed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object to throw an exception when trying to configure the security filter chain.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object and catch any exceptions.
  Assert: Verify that the expected exception is thrown during the configuration.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the method properly handles configuration errors and that these are communicated to the caller through exceptions. This is important for debugging and error handling in the security configuration process.

Scenario 5: Ensure that filter chain is built

Details:  
  TestName: buildSecurityFilterChain
  Description: This test checks that the method returns a SecurityFilterChain object after successfully configuring HttpSecurity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and configure it to return a valid SecurityFilterChain upon build.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the build method is called and a SecurityFilterChain object is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that a SecurityFilterChain object is successfully created, which is essential for the security infrastructure to function. It ensures that the security filter chain is properly set up and ready to be applied to incoming requests.
