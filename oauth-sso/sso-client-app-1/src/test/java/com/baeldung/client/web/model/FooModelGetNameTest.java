Scenario 1: Test getName method when name is not empty

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenNotEmpty
  Description: This test will verify that the getName method returns a non-empty string when the name field is set to a non-empty value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and use a setter method or constructor to set the name field to a known non-empty string.
  Act: Call the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the non-empty string set earlier.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getName method correctly retrieves the value of the name field when it is not empty. It's significant to ensure the method handles standard use cases correctly.

Scenario 2: Test getName method when name is empty

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenEmpty
  Description: This test will check that the getName method returns an empty string if the name field has been set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and use a setter method or constructor to set the name field to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is empty.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the getName method accurately reflects an empty state of the name field. It's important for situations where the name might not have been set and should default to an empty string.

Scenario 3: Test getName method when name is null

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenNull
  Description: This test will ensure that the getName method handles null values properly by returning null or a default value, depending on the implementation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the name field, leaving it null.
  Act: Call the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null or a predefined default value.
Validation:
  This assertion checks how the getName method behaves when the name field is null, which is crucial for understanding the method's behavior in the absence of data and preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 4: Test getName method for consistency

Details:
  TestName: getNameConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test will check that the getName method returns a consistent result when called multiple times without changing the underlying name field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field to a known value. Call the getName method once to get an initial result.
  Act: Call the getName method on the instance several more times.
  Assert: Assert that all returned values are the same as the initial result.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the getName method is idempotent and returns a consistent value across multiple invocations without side effects. This is important to ensure that the method does not alter the state of the object.

Scenario 5: Test getName method for thread safety

Details:
  TestName: getNameThreadSafetyCheck
  Description: This test will verify that the getName method is thread-safe by calling it from multiple threads simultaneously and checking for consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field to a known value. Start multiple threads that will call the getName method on the same instance.
  Act: Execute all threads and collect their results.
  Assert: Assert that all threads received the same name value.
Validation:
  This assertion is important to confirm that the getName method can be safely called from multiple threads without causing inconsistent or corrupted state, which is crucial for applications that require concurrency.

Note: Since the getName method is a simple accessor, most of these scenarios assume that the name field is mutable and can be set either through a constructor or a setter method. If the name field is final and only set through the constructor, the Arrange step would involve creating new instances with the desired name value.
