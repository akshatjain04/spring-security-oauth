================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: The toString method exposes potentially sensitive object information, such as 'id' and 'name', which could lead to information leakage if logged or displayed in an insecure context.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive information in the toString method. Use a logging framework that supports redaction or implement a custom method for secure logging.

Vulnerability: Insecure Object Deserialization
Issue: If the class 'Foo' is serializable, deserialization of untrusted data can lead to security flaws. Without seeing the full context, it's unclear if the object's fields are properly validated during deserialization.
Solution: Ensure that the class implements secure deserialization methods. Validate all fields after deserialization and consider using a serialization proxy or the Java Serialization Filter to restrict which classes can be deserialized.

Vulnerability: Logging Sensitive Data
Issue: The toString method may be automatically used by logging frameworks, potentially writing sensitive information to logs that are not properly secured.
Solution: Review and sanitize any logged output that may contain sensitive information. Configure logging frameworks to mask or omit sensitive data.

Vulnerability: Missing Class Definition
Issue: The provided code snippet is missing the full class definition, including member variables and their access modifiers. Exposing internal representation can pose a security risk.
Solution: Ensure that the class is properly encapsulated with private member variables and provide controlled access through getters and setters. Consider also implementing checks within these methods to prevent malicious manipulation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify toString returns correct format for non-null fields

Details:  
  TestName: toStringReturnsCorrectFormat
  Description: This test checks whether the toString method returns a string in the expected format when the id and name fields are not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with non-null id and name fields.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected format "Foo [id=value, name=value]".
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly formats the string with the provided field values. This is important to ensure that the object's string representation is consistent and readable for logging or debugging purposes.

Scenario 2: Verify toString handles null id field gracefully

Details:  
  TestName: toStringHandlesNullId
  Description: This test ensures that the toString method can handle a null id field without throwing an exception and includes "null" in the returned string for the id field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null id field and a non-null name field.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected format "Foo [id=null, name=value]".
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method can handle null values for the id field and still return a properly formatted string. This is significant for maintaining robustness in the application when dealing with objects that may not have all fields set.

Scenario 3: Verify toString handles null name field gracefully

Details:  
  TestName: toStringHandlesNullName
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method can handle a null name field without throwing an exception and includes "null" in the returned string for the name field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a non-null id field and a null name field.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected format "Foo [id=value, name=null]".
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method can handle null values for the name field and still return a properly formatted string. This is important for cases where the object's name is not yet determined or applicable.

Scenario 4: Verify toString handles both fields being null

Details:  
  TestName: toStringHandlesBothFieldsNull
  Description: This test ensures that the toString method returns the correct string format when both the id and name fields are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with both id and name fields set to null.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected format "Foo [id=null, name=null]".
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the method can produce a correctly formatted string even when all fields are null. This scenario is important to validate that the method is fully resilient to null values.

Scenario 5: Verify toString with empty string for name

Details:  
  TestName: toStringWithEmptyName
  Description: This test checks if the toString method correctly includes an empty string for the name field in the returned string format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a non-null id and an empty string for the name field.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected format "Foo [id=value, name=]".
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method correctly handles empty strings and reflects them in the string representation. This is significant for accurately representing objects that have an empty string as a valid state for the name field.

Scenario 6: Verify toString with whitespace in name

Details:  
  TestName: toStringWithWhitespaceInName
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method includes names with leading or trailing whitespace in the returned string format without alteration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a non-null id and a name field with leading or trailing whitespace.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected format "Foo [id=value, name= value ]" (assuming the name has whitespace).
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method preserves the exact value of the name field, including any whitespace, in the string representation. This is important for ensuring that the string output accurately reflects the object's state.
