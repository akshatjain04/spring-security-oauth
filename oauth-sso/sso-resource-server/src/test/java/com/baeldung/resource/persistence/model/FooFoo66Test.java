Scenario 1: Valid name provided for Foo object

Details:  
  TestName: createFooWithValidName
  Description: This test checks if the Foo constructor correctly assigns a valid String to the name field of the Foo object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a valid String for the name parameter.
  Act: Create a new Foo object using the valid name.
  Assert: Verify that the name field of the Foo object is equal to the provided valid String.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the constructor properly assigns the name field when provided with a valid String. This is important to ensure that Foo objects are created with the correct name as intended by the business logic.

Scenario 2: Null name provided for Foo object

Details:  
  TestName: createFooWithNullName
  Description: This test checks how the Foo constructor handles a null value for the name parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the name parameter to null.
  Act: Attempt to create a new Foo object with the null name.
  Assert: Verify that the appropriate exception is thrown or the name field is set to null, depending on the intended behavior.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the constructor behaves as expected when handling null input for the name. This is crucial for preventing unintended behavior or exceptions during runtime.

Scenario 3: Empty string provided as name for Foo object

Details:  
  TestName: createFooWithEmptyName
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Foo constructor when an empty string is passed as the name parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty String for the name parameter.
  Act: Create a new Foo object using the empty string as the name.
  Assert: Verify that the name field of the Foo object is set to an empty string or appropriate handling is performed.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the constructor handles empty strings as expected, which is important to ensure that Foo objects are not created with invalid or unintended names.

Scenario 4: Extremely long name provided for Foo object

Details:  
  TestName: createFooWithLongName
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Foo constructor when a very long String is passed as the name parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a very long String for the name parameter.
  Act: Create a new Foo object using the long string as the name.
  Assert: Verify that the name field of the Foo object is set to the long string or appropriate handling is performed.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the constructor can handle long strings and that the name field is assigned correctly. This test may be important to verify the system's limits and ensure data integrity.

Scenario 5: Special characters provided as name for Foo object

Details:  
  TestName: createFooWithSpecialCharactersName
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Foo constructor when the name parameter contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a String with special characters for the name parameter.
  Act: Create a new Foo object using the string with special characters as the name.
  Assert: Verify that the name field of the Foo object is set to the string with special characters or appropriate handling is performed.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the constructor properly handles strings with special characters. This is significant to confirm that Foo objects can have names with special characters if allowed by the system specifications.
