================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CORS Configuration
Issue: Permissive CORS policy can allow any domain to access the resources. This can lead to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) vulnerabilities if not correctly configured.
Solution: Define a more restrictive CORS policy by specifying allowed origins, HTTP methods, and headers. Use a CORS configuration source to control which domains are permitted to access resources.

Vulnerability: Missing CSRF Protection
Issue: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is not explicitly enabled, which can allow attackers to submit authenticated requests on behalf of users.
Solution: Enable CSRF protection by using .csrf().csrfTokenRepository(...) if state-changing endpoints are accessed via browser-based clients. For REST APIs typically accessed with bearer tokens, CSRF protection can be disabled as they are not susceptible to CSRF attacks.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Scope Validation
Issue: The application checks for 'SCOPE_read' and 'SCOPE_write' authorities, but there is no validation for the presence of required scopes beyond the naming convention. This could be exploited if the token issuing process is flawed.
Solution: Ensure proper validation of scopes in the JWT token. Implement additional checks or business logic to verify that the token contains all necessary scopes and claims for the requested operation.

Vulnerability: Hardcoded Security Configuration
Issue: Security configurations such as URL patterns and required scopes are hardcoded, which is not flexible and can lead to security misconfigurations when the application evolves.
Solution: Externalize security configurations to a properties file or a management system, allowing for dynamic changes without the need to recompile the code.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling
Issue: The method 'filterChain' declares throwing a generic 'Exception', which can lead to unintended information disclosure through stack traces or error messages.
Solution: Implement proper exception handling within the method. Catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, ensuring that sensitive error information is not exposed to clients.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful creation of SecurityFilterChain with proper authorities

Details:
  TestName: successfulSecurityFilterChainCreation
  Description: This test verifies that the SecurityFilterChain is successfully created and the configuration for the endpoint authorities is set correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and its method chain calls.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned SecurityFilterChain is not null and the HttpSecurity mock has been called with the correct authorities.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the SecurityFilterChain object is successfully created, implying that the method's configuration steps are executed without errors. This test is significant as it ensures that the security configuration aligns with the intended access controls for the application.

Scenario 2: Ensure GET /user/info requires SCOPE_read authority

Details:
  TestName: getToUserInfoRequiresScopeRead
  Description: This test ensures that the GET request to the /user/info endpoint is configured to require the SCOPE_read authority.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and its method chain calls.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the HttpSecurity mock has been set up to require the SCOPE_read authority for the GET /user/info endpoint.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the configuration mandates the SCOPE_read authority for the specified endpoint, which is critical for ensuring that only users with the correct permissions can access the user information.

Scenario 3: Ensure POST to /api/foos requires SCOPE_write authority

Details:
  TestName: postToApiFoosRequiresScopeWrite
  Description: This test checks that the POST request to the /api/foos endpoint is configured to require the SCOPE_write authority.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and its method chain calls.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the HttpSecurity mock has been set up to require the SCOPE_write authority for the POST /api/foos endpoint.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the endpoint configuration is enforcing the correct authority, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system by allowing only authorized writes to the /api/foos resource.

Scenario 4: Ensure that any other request requires authentication

Details:
  TestName: anyOtherRequestRequiresAuthentication
  Description: This test confirms that any request not matching the specified patterns requires authentication.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object and its method chain calls.
  Act: Invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the HttpSecurity mock has been set up to require authentication for any other request.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the default security configuration is to require authentication, thereby ensuring that all other endpoints are protected from unauthorized access.

Scenario 5: Exception handling when HttpSecurity setup fails

Details:
  TestName: exceptionHandlingDuringHttpSecuritySetup
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the filterChain method when there is a failure during the setup of HttpSecurity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpSecurity object to throw an Exception when any method is called.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the filterChain method with the mocked HttpSecurity object.
  Assert: Expect an Exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for the proper handling of exceptions, which is essential for the robustness of the application. It ensures that the method under test reacts appropriately to errors during security configuration setup.
