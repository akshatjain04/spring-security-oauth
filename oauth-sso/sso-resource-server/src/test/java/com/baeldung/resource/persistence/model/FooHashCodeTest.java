ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_abca8cefc9
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

Scenario 1: Entity with non-null id and name generates a consistent hashCode

Details:  
  TestName: entityWithNonNullFieldsGeneratesConsistentHashCode
  Description: This test ensures that the hashCode method generates a consistent hash code for an entity when both 'id' and 'name' fields are not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity with specific non-null 'id' and 'name' values.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the instance to obtain the hash code.
  Assert: Call the hashCode method again and compare the result with the previous hash code obtained.
Validation: 
  Confirm that the hash codes are identical across multiple invocations, which implies that the hash code is consistent for the same object. This is important as it is a requirement for objects that are used in hash-based collections like HashMap or HashSet.

Scenario 2: Entity with null id and non-null name generates a consistent hashCode

Details:  
  TestName: entityWithNullIdAndNonNullNameGeneratesConsistentHashCode
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode method generates a consistent hash code for an entity with a null 'id' and a non-null 'name'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an entity instance with 'id' set to null and 'name' set to a specific non-null value.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the instance to obtain the hash code.
  Assert: Call the hashCode method again and compare the result with the previous hash code obtained.
Validation: 
  Verify that the hash codes are identical across multiple invocations, ensuring that the presence of a null 'id' does not affect the consistency of the hash code. This is crucial for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Entity with non-null id and null name generates a consistent hashCode

Details:  
  TestName: entityWithNonNullIdAndNullNameGeneratesConsistentHashCode
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode method generates a consistent hash code for an entity with a non-null 'id' and a null 'name'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an entity instance with 'id' set to a specific non-null value and 'name' set to null.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the instance to obtain the hash code.
  Assert: Call the hashCode method again and compare the result with the previous hash code obtained.
Validation: 
  Confirm that the hash codes remain the same across invocations, indicating that a null 'name' does not compromise the hash code's consistency.

Scenario 4: Entity with null id and name generates a consistent hashCode

Details:  
  TestName: entityWithNullIdAndNameGeneratesConsistentHashCode
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates a consistent hash code for an entity with both 'id' and 'name' fields set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an entity instance with both 'id' and 'name' set to null.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the instance to obtain the hash code.
  Assert: Call the hashCode method again and compare the result with the previous hash code obtained.
Validation: 
  Validate that the hash codes are the same across invocations, ensuring that the hash code is consistent even when all fields involved in the calculation are null.

Scenario 5: Different entities with different fields generate different hashCodes

Details:  
  TestName: differentEntitiesWithDifferentFieldsGenerateDifferentHashCodes
  Description: This test ensures that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for two entities with different 'id' or 'name' values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different entity instances with distinct 'id' and 'name' values.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances to obtain their hash codes.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes of both entities and assert that they are not equal.
Validation: 
  Ensure that entities with different field values result in different hash codes, which is a requirement for proper distribution in hash-based collections.

Scenario 6: Same entity generates the same hashCode across different runs

Details:  
  TestName: sameEntityGeneratesSameHashCodeAcrossRuns
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode method generates the same hash code for an entity across different runs of the test.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the hash code of an entity instance during the first test run.
  Act: In a subsequent test run, create an identical entity instance and call the hashCode method to obtain the hash code.
  Assert: Compare the hash code obtained in the second run with the recorded hash code from the first run.
Validation: 
  Confirm that the hash codes are the same across different runs, which ensures that the hashCode implementation is stable and consistent over time.
