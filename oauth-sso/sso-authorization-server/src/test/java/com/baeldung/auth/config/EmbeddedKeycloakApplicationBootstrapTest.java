================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Hardcoded Credentials
Issue: The function 'createMasterRealmAdminUser()' suggests that there may be hardcoded administrative credentials within the codebase or configuration files for the master realm.
Solution: Remove any hardcoded credentials and instead use secure mechanisms for managing credentials such as environment variables, secure storage, or a secrets management system.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The use of 'ClassPathResource' and 'Resource' may indicate that the code is loading resources without ensuring their integrity, which can lead to loading malicious resources if an attacker has tampered with them.
Solution: Ensure that all resources are loaded from trusted sources and perform integrity checks, such as verifying cryptographic signatures or checksums, before using them.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The codebase may be using string concatenation to construct SQL queries, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if inputs are not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM frameworks that automatically handle input sanitation to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Methods such as 'JsonSerialization' suggest the application may be deserializing data without proper validation, which can lead to remote code execution if untrusted data is processed.
Solution: Implement whitelisting or validation of all deserialized objects, and avoid deserializing objects from untrusted sources. Consider using safer serialization formats such as JSON or protobuf.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code may be creating files or directories with insecure default permissions, exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users.
Solution: Set secure file permissions explicitly when creating files or directories, and follow the principle of least privilege.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Logging sensitive information using 'Logger' without proper sanitization can lead to information exposure through log files.
Solution: Sanitize log outputs to remove sensitive information, configure proper access control for log files, and use secure logging practices.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Bootstrap with Master Realm Admin User Creation and Baeldung Realm Creation

Details:
  TestName: bootstrapCreatesMasterRealmAndBaeldungRealm
  Description: This test verifies that the bootstrap method successfully initializes the ExportImportManager, creates a master realm admin user, and sets up the Baeldung realm. 

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the necessary dependencies such as the superclass bootstrap method, the method to create the master realm admin user, and the method to create the Baeldung realm.
  Act: Call the bootstrap method.
  Assert: Validate that the ExportImportManager is not null, and verify that the methods to create the master realm admin user and the Baeldung realm were called.

Validation:
  The assertion for a non-null ExportImportManager confirms that the bootstrap process was completed. Verifying the calls to create the master realm admin user and the Baeldung realm ensures that the initial setup is correctly performed. This test is significant as it ensures the proper initialization of the Keycloak server.

Scenario 2: Bootstrap Failure Due to Master Realm Admin User Creation Failure

Details:
  TestName: bootstrapFailsOnMasterRealmAdminUserCreation
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the bootstrap method when the creation of the master realm admin user fails.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the superclass bootstrap method to return a valid ExportImportManager and simulate a failure when creating the master realm admin user.
  Act: Attempt to call the bootstrap method.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown during the bootstrap process.

Validation:
  This test is critical for ensuring the bootstrap method's robustness in handling failures during the master realm admin user creation process. The expected exception indicates that the process cannot continue without a successful admin user creation, highlighting the dependency on this step for further initialization.

Scenario 3: Bootstrap Failure Due to Baeldung Realm Creation Failure

Details:
  TestName: bootstrapFailsOnBaeldungRealmCreation
  Description: This test ensures that the bootstrap method behaves correctly when there is a failure in creating the Baeldung realm.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the superclass bootstrap method to return a valid ExportImportManager, ensure that the master realm admin user creation is successful, and simulate a failure when creating the Baeldung realm.
  Act: Attempt to call the bootstrap method.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown during the bootstrap process.

Validation:
  The assertion for an expected exception ensures that the bootstrap method cannot complete if the Baeldung realm creation fails. This test is important to verify that all critical components of the initial setup are mandatory for successful bootstrap completion.

Scenario 4: Bootstrap with Superclass Method Returning Null

Details:
  TestName: bootstrapHandlesNullFromSuperclass
  Description: This test ensures that the bootstrap method can handle a scenario where the superclass bootstrap method returns null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the superclass bootstrap method to return null.
  Act: Call the bootstrap method.
  Assert: Expect an exception or a specific error handling behavior to occur due to the null return value from the superclass method.

Validation:
  This test checks the resilience of the bootstrap method when its dependencies do not behave as expected. The handling of a null return value is significant as it prevents the application from proceeding with an invalid state, thus preserving system integrity.

Scenario 5: Bootstrap with Already Existing Master Realm and Baeldung Realm

Details:
  TestName: bootstrapWithExistingRealms
  Description: This scenario tests the bootstrap method's behavior when the master realm and Baeldung realm already exist.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the necessary methods to return existing master realm and Baeldung realm, indicating that they have already been created.
  Act: Call the bootstrap method.
  Assert: Verify that the method does not attempt to recreate the realms and that it returns a valid ExportImportManager.

Validation:
  The test ensures that the bootstrap method is idempotent and does not attempt to recreate realms if they already exist. This is crucial for avoiding unnecessary operations and potential conflicts during the bootstrap process.
