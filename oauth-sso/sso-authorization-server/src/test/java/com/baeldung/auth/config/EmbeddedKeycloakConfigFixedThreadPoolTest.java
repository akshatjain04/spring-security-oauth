ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fixedThreadPool_5babfccb00

Scenario 1: Successful creation of a fixed thread pool

Details:
  TestName: fixedThreadPoolCreation
  Description: This test ensures that the fixedThreadPool method successfully creates an ExecutorService with a fixed number of threads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as the method does not depend on external input.
  Act: Invoke the fixedThreadPool method to create an ExecutorService instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is not null and is an instance of ExecutorService.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method returns a valid ExecutorService object. The significance of this test is to confirm that the method behaves as expected under normal conditions and creates a thread pool with the specified number of threads.

Scenario 2: Verify the number of threads in the pool

Details:
  TestName: fixedThreadPoolSizeVerification
  Description: This test verifies that the ExecutorService created by the fixedThreadPool method contains the correct number of threads as defined by its implementation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as the method does not depend on external input.
  Act: Invoke the fixedThreadPool method and submit a known number of tasks that exceed the pool size, capturing the thread names or IDs.
  Assert: Assert that the number of unique thread names or IDs does not exceed the expected number (5 in this case).
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the fixedThreadPool method does not create more threads than specified. This is important to ensure that the system resources are used as intended and to prevent potential issues with too many threads being created.

Scenario 3: Rejection of tasks after shutdown

Details:
  TestName: rejectTasksAfterShutdown
  Description: This test ensures that the ExecutorService created by the fixedThreadPool method rejects new tasks after it is shut down.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ExecutorService using the fixedThreadPool method and then shut it down.
  Act: Attempt to submit a new task to the ExecutorService after shutdown.
  Assert: Assert that the task submission throws a RejectedExecutionException.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the ExecutorService does not accept new tasks after shutdown, which is the expected behavior. This is critical for proper application shutdown and resource management.

Scenario 4: Thread pool allows task completion before shutdown

Details:
  TestName: completeTasksBeforeShutdown
  Description: This test checks that the ExecutorService created by the fixedThreadPool method allows running tasks to complete before shutting down.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ExecutorService using the fixedThreadPool method, submit a task that includes a delay, and then initiate a shutdown.
  Act: Wait for a specified time that allows the task to complete and then check the task's completion status.
  Assert: Assert that the task has completed successfully.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the ExecutorService allows for the graceful completion of tasks before shutting down. This is necessary to prevent abrupt termination of ongoing tasks and potential data corruption or loss.

Scenario 5: Thread pool interruptibility on shutdownNow

Details:
  TestName: threadPoolInterruptibilityOnShutdownNow
  Description: This test verifies that the threads in the ExecutorService created by the fixedThreadPool method can be interrupted when shutdownNow is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ExecutorService using the fixedThreadPool method, submit a long-running task that handles interruptions, and then call shutdownNow.
  Act: Check if the long-running task was interrupted.
  Assert: Assert that the task was interrupted.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the shutdownNow method interrupts running tasks. This is important for ensuring that resources can be released quickly when the application needs to shut down immediately.

Scenario 6: Thread reuse in thread pool

Details:
  TestName: threadReuseInThreadPool
  Description: This test ensures that the ExecutorService created by the fixedThreadPool method reuses threads for multiple tasks.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ExecutorService using the fixedThreadPool method, submit a small number of short-lived tasks, and capture the thread names or IDs.
  Act: Submit another set of tasks and capture the thread names or IDs.
  Assert: Assert that some thread names or IDs from the first set of tasks reappear in the second set, indicating thread reuse.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the thread pool reuses threads for different tasks, which is a key feature of a fixed thread pool to optimize performance and resource utilization.
