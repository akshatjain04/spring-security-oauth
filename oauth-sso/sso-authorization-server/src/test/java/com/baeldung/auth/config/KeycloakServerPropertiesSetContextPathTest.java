================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-488: Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session
Issue: The contextPath variable may be shared across different user sessions if not properly encapsulated within a session-controlled object, leading to potential data leakage between sessions.
Solution: Ensure that any user-specific data are stored in session attributes or in a stateless manner that does not allow for accidental sharing between sessions.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: If the contextPath is used to access file system resources and the default permissions are too permissive, it could allow unauthorized access to files.
Solution: Always set secure permissions for files and directories, restricting access to only those users who require it. Validate and sanitize input to avoid path traversal vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper validation, the contextPath could be manipulated to access unauthorized resources or perform directory traversal attacks.
Solution: Implement strict input validation for contextPath to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters or patterns.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The setter method could inadvertently expose internal object state if used improperly, leading to information disclosure.
Solution: Limit the exposure of sensitive information by using setter methods only when necessary and ensure that any sensitive data is not logged or exposed through error messages or stack traces.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: If the contextPath is used to control access to critical resources without proper authorization checks, it could lead to privilege escalation.
Solution: Ensure that access control checks are in place when using contextPath to determine resource access, and follow the principle of least privilege.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid context path setting

Details:
  TestName: setValidContextPath
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly sets a valid context path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid context path value.
  Act: Invoke setContextPath with the valid context path.
  Assert: Retrieve the contextPath field value and assert that it is equal to the set value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the contextPath field holds the value passed to setContextPath. This test confirms that the method properly sets the context path in the configuration properties, which is crucial for correct application routing.

Scenario 2: Null context path setting

Details:
  TestName: setNullContextPath
  Description: This test verifies that the method can handle a null context path without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null string variable.
  Act: Invoke setContextPath with the null string.
  Assert: Retrieve the contextPath field value and assert that it is null.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the contextPath field is set to null when provided with a null input. This test is significant because it ensures the method's stability and robustness when encountering null values.

Scenario 3: Empty string as context path

Details:
  TestName: setEmptyContextPath
  Description: This test ensures that the method accepts an empty string as a valid context path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty string variable.
  Act: Invoke setContextPath with the empty string.
  Assert: Retrieve the contextPath field value and assert that it is equal to the empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the contextPath field is set to an empty string when provided with such input. This test is important to verify that the method correctly handles empty strings, which might represent a default or unset state in the application's configuration.

Scenario 4: Context path with white spaces

Details:
  TestName: setContextPathWithWhiteSpaces
  Description: This test checks how the method handles a context path that contains leading or trailing white spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable with white spaces at the beginning and end.
  Act: Invoke setContextPath with this string.
  Assert: Retrieve the contextPath field value and assert that it is trimmed or matches the original string, depending on the application's requirements.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the contextPath field is set according to the application's requirements concerning white spaces. This test is vital to ensure that the method behaves consistently with the application's expectations for context path formatting.

Scenario 5: Context path with special characters

Details:
  TestName: setContextPathWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test assesses the method's ability to set a context path that includes special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable with special characters.
  Act: Invoke setContextPath with this string.
  Assert: Retrieve the contextPath field value and assert that it matches the string with special characters.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the contextPath field accurately reflects the input string, special characters included. This test is critical to ensure that the method can handle context paths that might contain characters used in URL encoding or other special purposes.
