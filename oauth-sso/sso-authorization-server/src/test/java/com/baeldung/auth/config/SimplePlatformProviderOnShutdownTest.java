================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unrestricted File Path
Issue: The import statement 'import java.io.File;' suggests that file system access is being handled, which can expose the application to directory traversal attacks if not properly sanitized.
Solution: Ensure that any file path inputs are strictly validated against a whitelist of allowed paths and characters. Use secure APIs that provide path normalization and access control.

Vulnerability: Logging Sensitive Information
Issue: The import 'import org.keycloak.services.ServicesLogger;' indicates use of a logging framework, which could lead to logging sensitive information if not properly configured.
Solution: Configure logging to exclude sensitive information. Use context-based logging and avoid logging user credentials, tokens, or any personal identifiable information (PII).

Vulnerability: Shutdown Hook Exposure
Issue: The 'onShutdown' method allows for the registration of a shutdown hook, which if exposed to unauthorized users, could be misused to trigger a shutdown or manipulate the hook for malicious purposes.
Solution: Ensure that the access to the 'onShutdown' method is restricted to trusted parts of the application. Validate the provided Runnable for security concerns before executing.

Vulnerability: Improper Configuration Management
Issue: The imports related to 'org.keycloak.common.Profile' suggest the use of external configuration files, which might contain sensitive data and could be a target for attackers if not properly secured.
Solution: Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access. Encrypt sensitive information within configuration files and use secure methods to access these values.

Vulnerability: Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities
Issue: The usage of third-party libraries (e.g., Keycloak) could introduce vulnerabilities if the libraries are outdated or misconfigured.
Solution: Regularly update third-party libraries to the latest secure versions. Follow best practices for configuring and securing these libraries as recommended by the maintainers.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Runnable Shutdown Hook

Details:  
  TestName: onShutdownWithValidRunnable
  Description: This test verifies that a valid Runnable instance can be set as a shutdown hook without any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Runnable instance.
  Act: Call the onShutdown method with the mock Runnable instance.
  Assert: No assertion is needed as the test should pass if no exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  Confirm that passing a valid Runnable does not result in an exception. This test is significant to ensure that the method accepts proper shutdown hooks and that the application can register shutdown tasks correctly.

Scenario 2: Null Runnable Shutdown Hook

Details:  
  TestName: onShutdownWithNullRunnable
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior when a null reference is passed as a shutdown hook.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the Runnable reference to null.
  Act: Call the onShutdown method with the null reference.
  Assert: No assertion is needed as the test should pass if no exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  Verify that the method can handle null input without throwing an exception. This test is important for validating the robustness of the method in handling null inputs.

Scenario 3: Multiple Invocations of onShutdown

Details:  
  TestName: onShutdownWithMultipleInvocations
  Description: This test ensures that the method can handle being called multiple times, potentially with different Runnable instances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two mock Runnable instances.
  Act: Call the onShutdown method first with one instance, then with the second instance.
  Assert: No assertion is needed as the test should pass if no exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  Check that multiple invocations of the method with different Runnables do not cause errors or exceptions. This test checks that the method can be used flexibly throughout the application lifecycle.

Scenario 4: Runnable Execution Upon Shutdown

Details:  
  TestName: onShutdownRunnableExecutesOnShutdown
  Description: This test assesses whether the Runnable provided to onShutdown is actually executed upon application shutdown.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Runnable with a flag that can be checked for execution.
  Act: Call the onShutdown method with the mock Runnable, then simulate a shutdown event.
  Assert: Assert that the flag in the mock Runnable is set, indicating execution.
Validation: 
  Ensure that the shutdown hook is not only accepted but also executed at the appropriate time. This is critical to confirm that shutdown tasks are run as expected, part of proper application termination.

Scenario 5: Exception Handling in Runnable

Details:  
  TestName: onShutdownWithRunnableThrowingException
  Description: This test checks how the method handles a Runnable that throws an exception during execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Runnable that throws an exception when run.
  Act: Call the onShutdown method with the exception-throwing Runnable, then simulate a shutdown event.
  Assert: Assert that the exception is handled gracefully, without crashing the application.
Validation: 
  Validate that the method is capable of dealing with Runnables that may not execute as expected and that such scenarios do not destabilize the application. This is vital for ensuring the resilience of the application's shutdown process.
