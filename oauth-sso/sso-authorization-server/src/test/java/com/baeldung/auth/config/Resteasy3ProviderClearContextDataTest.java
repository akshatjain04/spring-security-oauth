ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=clearContextData_ce02bed04a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) / CWE-639
Issue: The method 'clearContextData' clears the context data without any checks, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access if the context contains sensitive information.
Solution: Implement proper access controls and checks before clearing the context data to ensure that only authorized users can perform this action.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling / CWE-755
Issue: The method does not handle any exceptions that might be thrown during the clearing of context data, which could lead to information disclosure or denial of service.
Solution: Add appropriate exception handling around the context clearing logic to manage any errors or exceptions gracefully.

Vulnerability: Potential misuse of third-party libraries
Issue: The code imports classes from third-party libraries (e.g., org.jboss.resteasy, org.keycloak) without specifying versions or managing dependencies securely, which may lead to dependency confusion or the use of outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Use a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle to specify exact versions of third-party libraries and enable dependency checking for outdated or vulnerable libraries.

Vulnerability: Lack of input validation / CWE-20
Issue: The code does not show any form of input validation before performing operations, which could lead to various attacks if the method interacts with user input or data from untrusted sources.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are validated against a strict specification before they are used within the method, especially if they influence context data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify that context data is cleared successfully

Details:
  TestName: clearContextDataShouldSucceed
  Description: This test ensures that the context data is cleared without any exceptions or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResteasyContext and simulate any necessary preconditions, if applicable.
  Act: Invoke the clearContextData method.
  Assert: Verify that ResteasyContext.clearContextData() was called.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify that the clearContextData method delegates the call to ResteasyContext's static method to clear the context data. The expected result is that the context should be cleared, which is significant for preventing data leaks or incorrect data being passed to subsequent requests in a shared environment like a web server.

Scenario 2: Verify behavior when ResteasyContext throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: clearContextDataShouldHandleExceptionsGracefully
  Description: This test checks that the clearContextData method handles any exceptions thrown by the ResteasyContext properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResteasyContext to throw a RuntimeException when clearContextData is called.
  Act: Invoke the clearContextData method.
  Assert: Expect no exceptions to be thrown by the clearContextData method itself.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify that the clearContextData method is robust and can handle exceptions from the ResteasyContext without propagating them. This is crucial for ensuring the application's stability, even when faced with unexpected errors during context data clearance.

Scenario 3: Verify that clearContextData is idempotent

Details:
  TestName: clearContextDataShouldBeIdempotent
  Description: This test ensures that multiple invocations of the clearContextData method do not cause any adverse effects or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResteasyContext as needed.
  Act: Invoke the clearContextData method multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that ResteasyContext.clearContextData() was called the correct number of times.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to confirm that the method can be called multiple times without any side effects, which is important for ensuring that the method behaves predictably and consistently across multiple invocations.

Scenario 4: Verify that clearContextData does not affect other ResteasyContext operations

Details:
  TestName: clearContextDataShouldNotAffectOtherOperations
  Description: This test checks that the clearContextData method does not interfere with other operations that might be performed by the ResteasyContext.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResteasyContext and perform some other operations before and after calling clearContextData.
  Act: Invoke the clearContextData method.
  Assert: Verify that other operations on ResteasyContext remain unaffected.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify that the clearContextData method is self-contained and does not have unintended side effects on other parts of the ResteasyContext. This is essential to maintain the integrity of the application's context management.
