================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Active Debug Code
Issue: The inclusion of debug functionality, such as logging or other mechanisms that can provide insight into the application's operation, can expose sensitive information if not properly protected.
Solution: Ensure that debug code is disabled in production or protected by strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

Vulnerability: CWE-2: Environmental Security Issues
Issue: The code imports numerous external libraries, which could lead to environmental security issues if these libraries are not kept up-to-date or if they contain vulnerabilities.
Solution: Regularly update all third-party libraries to their latest versions and perform security audits on them. Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify known vulnerabilities in the included libraries.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The code does not explicitly show the shutdown or release of resources which can lead to resource leaks if not handled properly within the KeycloakSession or other resources.
Solution: Ensure that all acquired resources are released properly. Use try-with-resources statements where applicable for automatic resource management.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If any user-supplied data is reflected back in web pages without proper encoding, it may lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Sanitize and encode all user-supplied data before reflecting it back in web pages to prevent XSS attacks. Use existing libraries like OWASP Java Encoder for encoding.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The use of a detailed exception message in NoSuchElementException could potentially expose sensitive configuration details or system information to an attacker.
Solution: Use generic error messages in production environments and ensure that detailed logs are only available to authorized personnel.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If any part of the system uses random values for security purposes, such as tokens or session identifiers, it is crucial to use a secure source of randomness.
Solution: Use secure random number generators like java.security.SecureRandom for any security-related random value generation.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: If the application processes XML input, it may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks unless properly configured to prevent them.
Solution: Disable XML external entity processing in all XML parsers used within the application. Configure parsers to not resolve external entities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful configuration loading

Details:  
  TestName: loadConfigSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies if the configuration is loaded successfully when the factory creates a non-empty Optional.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the JsonConfigProviderFactory and its create method to return a non-empty Optional.
  Act: Invoke the loadConfig method.
  Assert: No exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  Validate that the method completes without throwing any exceptions, indicating that the configuration was loaded successfully. This test confirms the method's ability to handle valid configurations.

Scenario 2: Configuration loading with no value present

Details:  
  TestName: loadConfigWithNoValuePresent
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the loadConfig method when the factory creates an empty Optional, which should throw a NoSuchElementException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the JsonConfigProviderFactory and its create method to return an empty Optional.
  Act: Invoke the loadConfig method.
  Assert: Expect a NoSuchElementException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  Confirm that a NoSuchElementException is thrown, verifying that the method correctly handles the scenario where no configuration is present. This test ensures that the method signals a failure when there's no configuration to load.

Scenario 3: JsonConfigProviderFactory instantiation failure

Details:  
  TestName: loadConfigWithFactoryInstantiationFailure
  Description: This test verifies the loadConfig method's behavior when the JsonConfigProviderFactory cannot be instantiated properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the test environment such that the instantiation of JsonConfigProviderFactory throws an exception.
  Act: Invoke the loadConfig method.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown (the specific type depends on the nature of the instantiation failure).
Validation: 
  Check for an exception to ensure that the method handles the scenario where the factory cannot be created. This test confirms the robustness of the loadConfig method in the face of instantiation failures.

Scenario 4: Config initialization failure

Details:  
  TestName: loadConfigWithInitializationFailure
  Description: This test is designed to check if an exception is properly thrown when the Config initialization fails within the loadConfig method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the JsonConfigProviderFactory and its create method to return a non-empty Optional, but make the Config.init method throw an exception (e.g., RuntimeException).
  Act: Invoke the loadConfig method.
  Assert: Expect the same exception thrown by Config.init to be propagated.
Validation: 
  Verify that the exception thrown by Config.init is not caught inside the loadConfig method, ensuring that initialization failures are not silently ignored. This test checks the propagation of errors during the configuration initialization process.
