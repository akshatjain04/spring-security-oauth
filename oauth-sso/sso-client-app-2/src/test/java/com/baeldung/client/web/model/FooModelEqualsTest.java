================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: If 'FooModel' is used within a session management context and 'id' or 'name' are related to session identifiers, the lack of proper session expiration handling can lead to session fixation attacks.
Solution: Implement session management best practices, including regenerating session IDs upon authentication and ensuring proper session expiration.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The 'equals' method may leak information about the existence of 'id' or 'name' through error messages or logs if exceptions are not properly handled.
Solution: Catch potential exceptions in the 'equals' method and handle them without revealing sensitive information. Use generic error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-497: Exposure of System Data to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
Issue: If 'id' or 'name' contains system data or configuration details, comparing them in the 'equals' method might expose them to other objects without proper access control.
Solution: Ensure that 'id' and 'name' do not contain sensitive system data, or implement proper access controls when dealing with such information.

Vulnerability: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
Issue: The 'equals' method assumes 'id' and 'name' are immutable. If these fields can be modified externally, it could lead to incorrect equals behavior or race conditions.
Solution: Make 'id' and 'name' private and final if possible, or ensure thread-safe access if they must be mutable.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Objects are the same instance
Details:
  TestName: objectsAreSameInstance
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two references point to the same object instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FooModel and assign it to two different references.
  Act: Call the equals method on one reference, passing the other reference as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that the two references are to the same object instance. This is significant as it is the most basic case of equality.

Scenario 2: Object is compared with null
Details:
  TestName: objectComparedWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when the object is compared with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FooModel and use null for the comparison.
  Act: Call the equals method on the instance, passing null as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that an object is not equal to null. This is important for ensuring that the method behaves correctly with null values.

Scenario 3: Objects of different classes
Details:
  TestName: objectsOfDifferentClasses
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when comparing FooModel instance with an instance of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FooModel and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the FooModel instance, passing the instance of the different class as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method recognizes objects of different classes are not equivalent. This is crucial for type safety and correct class comparison.

Scenario 4: Objects with different id values
Details:
  TestName: objectsWithDifferentIds
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when two FooModel instances have different id values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of FooModel with different id values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies objects with different id values are not equal. This is important for object uniqueness based on the id field.

Scenario 5: Objects with one id being null
Details:
  TestName: oneObjectIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when one FooModel instance has a null id and the other has a non-null id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of FooModel where one has a null id and the other has a non-null id.
  Act: Call the equals method on the instance with a non-null id, passing the instance with a null id as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method can handle null values correctly in the id field and does not consider objects with a null id equal to those with a non-null id.

Scenario 6: Objects with different name values
Details:
  TestName: objectsWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when two FooModel instances have different name values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of FooModel with different name values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies objects with different name values are not equal. This is important for object uniqueness based on the name field.

Scenario 7: Objects with one name being null
Details:
  TestName: oneObjectNameIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when one FooModel instance has a null name and the other has a non-null name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of FooModel where one has a null name and the other has a non-null name.
  Act: Call the equals method on the instance with a non-null name, passing the instance with a null name as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method can handle null values correctly in the name field and does not consider objects with a null name equal to those with a non-null name.

Scenario 8: Objects are equal with non-null fields
Details:
  TestName: objectsAreEqualWithNonNullFields
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when two FooModel instances have the same non-null id and name values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of FooModel with the same non-null id and name values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies objects with the same non-null id and name values as equal. This is important for object comparison based on business logic.
